      <h1>Maigc Box </h1>
      <p>In this repository you will find an implementaton of the <b>Magic Box</b> which is a square matrix whose rows and columns are in 
      <b>ODD</b> numbers, it is called by that name because when adding the numbers of a row and the numbers of a column they will be equal
      and also when adding the numbers in diagonal they will also give the same number.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Algorithm</h4>
      <p>The algorithm is so simple. You will first place the number 1 at the center of the first row. Then, ask yourself if the next number (which is 2 in our case) is divisible by 3. If it is, increase the row by one; if not, you need to decrement both the row and the column by one. And that's it.</p>
